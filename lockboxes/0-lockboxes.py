Exercice:
You have n number of locked boxes in front of you.
Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1
and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.
Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    """
    This function will check if all the boxes can be opened using
    a key found in another box.

    Args:
        boxes (list of lists): A list where each index represents a box,
        and the inner list contains keys to other boxes.

    Returns:
        bool: True if all boxes can be opened, otherwise False.

    Explanation:
        - We start with the first box (index 0) already opened.
        - We collect all keys found in the first box.
        - Using a loop, we check if the keys can unlock new boxes.
        - If a new box is opened, we add its keys to our collection.
        - This continues until no new keys are found.
        - If we have opened all boxes, return True; otherwise, return False.
